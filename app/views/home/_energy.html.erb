			I was a part of a two-person team developing a multi-intelligent agentsystem. 
			Intelligent Agents are autonomous, social, reactive, and proactive. Therefore, 
			they arecommonly considered to be artificially intelligent. I developed the entire 
			backend of the system inwhich a ‘Home’ Agent will dynamically calculate energy 
			needs of ‘Appliance’ agents hourly. It thencontacts three energy ‘Supplier’ 
			agents for a quote, and negotiates with each based on thehome’s budget, eventually
			selecting the lowest available price. The complexity of this projectderives 
			from the fact that is entirely Agent Oriented. This was developed in Java 
			using the JADE AgentDevelopment Framework. <br />
				
			My teammate and I met weekly, discussing our progress and overall visionfor the program.<br />
			
			Ultimately, the project was a success and I achieved a distinction.
