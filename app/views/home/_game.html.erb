			This independent project which implements many core aspects of game development was built in c++ without that use of a game development library. <br />
			It incorporates the component pattern for each of its entities, uses a game state machine, loads the entire world from a configuration file as well as each location into a graph data structure, has a built in messaging system and implements a robust command processing pattern. <br /> 
			The game contains several locations, items, enemies and was completed using an object oriented style with a heavy emphasis on inheritance and polymorphism
