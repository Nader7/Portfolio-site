			This independent project which implements many core aspects of gamedevelopment was built in c++ without that use of a game development library. It incorporates thecomponent pattern for each of its entities, uses a game state machine, loads the entire worldfrom a configuration file as well as each location into a graph data structure, has a built inmessaging system and implements a robust command processing pattern. The game contains several locations,items, enemies and was
			completed using an object oriented style with a heavy emphasis oninheritance and polymorphism
